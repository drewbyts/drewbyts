### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst and coder who spends more time at coffeeshops than his actual home.

I'm active online, in the short-form, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drewbyts), and long-form, [Substack](https://substack.com/profile/36255055-andrew-ramirez?utm_source=user-menu). 

I have experience with R, Python, Tailwind CSS, Google Analytics, and Adobe Suite.

I'm currently learning React.js!

Want to connect, send me a [DM](https://twitter.com/drewbyts). Want to know me at the core? Check out my [website](https://drewbyts.netlify.app). I'd love to collaborate on new projects!
