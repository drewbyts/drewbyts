### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data anlyst and developer who spends more time at coffeeshops than his actual home.

I'm active online, but in the form of posting tangential jokes on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drewbyts) (I really should stop). 

Want to connect, send me a [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/drewbyts). I'd love to collaborate on new projects!
